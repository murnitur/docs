Presets, or prompt templates, in Murnitur AI are predefined sets of prompts designed to streamline the development and testing of Large Language Models (LLMs). These templates provide a consistent structure for inputs, allowing you to quickly deploy and test various scenarios without creating prompts from scratch. By using presets, you can save time, ensure uniformity, and focus on optimizing their LLM applications.

## Use cases

- **Navigate to Presets**: Access the Presets section on the sidebar menu and create a new preset.
- **Configure the Initial Version**: Set up the initial version of the preset by defining the prompts and parameters according to your requirements.

- **Add More Versions**: Expand the preset's functionality by adding additional versions as needed. Each added version automatically becomes the active version, allowing for easy comparison and testing.
