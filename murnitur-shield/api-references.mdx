Murnitur Shield is now accessible through comprehensive APIs, allowing seamless integration with your systems. These APIs enable real-time interception, PII detection, sentiment analysis, and detailed reporting, helping you enhance security, improve user experience, and gain deeper insights into your data.

## Request Construct

### `payload`

The `payload` parameter is a dictionary containing the data you want to inspect and filter. It typically includes:

- `input`: The original input data from the user.
- `output`: The generated output data from your system.

### `config`

The config parameter is a dictionary containing various configuration options for Murnitur Shield. It includes keys such as `murnitur_key`, `provider`, `model`, `group`, `api_key`, `base_url`, and `headers`.


## Prompt Injection

Prompt injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates input prompts to alter the behavior of AI models. By injecting malicious or deceptive instructions, attackers can cause models to generate unintended or harmful outputs. Murnitur Shield mitigates this risk by detecting and intercepting suspicious prompts, ensuring the integrity and safety of AI interactions.

### Features

In Murnitur Shield, we detect the following types of prompt injections:

- Impersonation
- Obfuscation
- Simple Instruction
- Few Shot
- New Context
- Hypothetical Scenario
- Personal Information Request
- Opinion Solicitation
- Instruction Override

Our solution is model-agnostic, allowing you to choose which LLM provider and model to use.
