Murnitur Shield is designed to protect your system from bad inputs and safeguard your users from harmful outputs. Think of it as a firewall for your data, ensuring that only appropriate content gets through.

## Generate API Key

- Visit [murnitur.ai](https://murnitur.ai) and sign in to your account.
- Navigate to the API key section and generate a new API key.

## Install Murnitur

Install the Murnitur package using pip:

```bash bash
pip install murnitur
```

## Define Rulesets

Rulesets are the core of Murnitur Shield, containing specific rules your application must comply with. They help determine what gets flagged or filtered based on predefined criteria.

Example ruleset:

```python python
from murnitur.guard import RuleSet

rulesets: list[RuleSet] = [
    {
        "rules": [
            {
                "metric": "pii",
                "operator": "contains",
                "value": ["email", "ssn", "address", "phone_number"],
            },
        ],
        "action": {
            "type": "OVERRIDE",
            "fallback": "Sorry, I can't provide personal identifiable information.",
        },
    },
]
```

Each ruleset includes:

- **Metric**: The type of content to check (e.g., PII).
- **Operator**: The condition to evaluate (e.g., "contains").
- **Value**: Specific values to look for (e.g., "email", "ssn").
- **Action**: What to do if a rule is triggered, such as overriding the response with a fallback message.

## Start the Firewall

Initialize Murnitur Shield to start filtering content:

```python python
payload = {
    "output": "James lives at 567 X. Elm St., Chicago, IL 60614.",
    "input": "Give me James' home address",
}

response = Guard.shield(
    payload=payload,
    rulesets=rulesets,
    group="development",
    murnitur_key="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
)
```

## Quick Wiki

### `payload`

The `payload` parameter is a dictionary containing the data you want to inspect and filter. It typically includes:

- `input`: The original input data from the user.
- `output`: The generated output data from your system.

Example:

```python python
payload = {
    "input": "User input data here",
    "output": "Generated output data here"
}
```

### `rulesets`

The `rulesets` parameter is a list of `RuleSet` objects defining the rules your application must comply with. Each `RuleSet` contains:

- `rules`: A list of individual rules to check against the `payload`.
  - `metric`: The type of content to evaluate (e.g., "pii" for Personally Identifiable Information).
  - `operator`: The condition to apply (e.g., "contains").
  - `value`: Specific values to look for (e.g., ["email", "ssn"]).
- `action`: The action to take if a rule is triggered.
  - `type`: The type of action (e.g., "OVERRIDE").
  - `fallback`: The fallback response if the action type is "OVERRIDE".

Example:

```python python
rulesets = [
    {
        "rules": [
            {
                "metric": "pii",
                "operator": "contains",
                "value": ["email", "ssn", "address", "phone_number"]
            }
        ],
        "action": {
            "type": "OVERRIDE",
            "fallback": "Sorry, I can't provide personal identifiable information."
        }
    }
]
```

### `group`

The `group` parameter is an optional string that categorizes the set of rules being applied. It helps in organizing and managing different rule sets for various environments or projects.

Example:

```python python
group = "development"
```

### `murnitur_key`

The `murnitur_key` is a required string containing your Murnitur API key. This key authenticates your requests, capture interceptions, and links them to your account.

Example:

```python python
murnitur_key = "your_api_key_here"
```

### `openai_key`

The `openai_key` is an optional string containing your OpenAI API key. This key is required if you use any OpenAI-specific metrics in your rulesets.

### `model`

By default we use `gpt-3.5-turbo` but you can change it to any OpenAI model.

Example:

```python python
openai_key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```

### Complete Example

Here is a complete example of using Murnitur Shield with all the parameters:

```python python
from murnitur import Guard

response = Guard.shield(
    payload={
        "input": "User input data here",
        "output": "Generated output data here"
    },
    rulesets=[
        {
            "rules": [
                {
                    "metric": "pii",
                    "operator": "contains",
                    "value": ["email", "ssn", "address", "phone_number"]
                }
            ],
            "action": {
                "type": "OVERRIDE",
                "fallback": "Sorry, I can't provide personal identifiable information."
            }
        }
    ],
    group="development",
    murnitur_key="your_api_key_here",
    openai_key="your_openai_api_key_here"
)
```
