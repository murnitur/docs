Monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs) enables you to track the model's internal processes and interactions. This includes monitoring inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps taken by the model during inference. By using tracing, developers can gain valuable insights into how the LLM processes data, make performance optimizations, and diagnose issues such as unexpected behavior or errors. To leverage tracing for your LLM, ensure that the SDK is properly [set up](/installation) and your generated API key is included in the configuration.

## Why We Need Monitoring for LLMs

- **Performance Optimization**: Monitoring helps identify inefficiencies in the model's performance, enabling developers to make necessary adjustments for faster and more accurate results.

- **Error Detection**: Continuous monitoring allows for the early detection of errors or anomalies in the model’s output, ensuring timely interventions and corrections.

- **Resource Management**: By tracking the model’s resource usage, such as tokens and costs, monitoring aids in optimizing resource allocation and preventing potential bottlenecks and overspending.

- **Security and Compliance**: Monitoring can help detect and prevent unauthorized usage or potential security breaches, ensuring that the model operates within the set compliance guidelines.

- **User Experience**: Ensuring consistent performance and reliability through monitoring directly impacts the end-user experience, fostering trust and satisfaction in the application.

- **Feedback and Improvement**: Ongoing monitoring provides valuable data and insights that can be used to iteratively improve the model and adapt it to changing requirements or new data inputs.

## What Makes Murnitur Stand Out

- **Minimal Latency Impact**: Murnitur seamlessly integrates with your application without adding significant latency, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness.

- **Effortless Integration**: With just two lines of code, developers can quickly implement tracing in their applications, streamlining the monitoring process and reducing development time.

- **Automatic Evaluation and Hallucination Detection**: Murnitur features built-in capabilities to automatically evaluate model performance and detect hallucinations, saving developers time and effort in manual assessment and debugging.
