## Defining Tasks with `@murnitur.task`

Tasks in Murnitur are reusable units of work that can be traced and monitored. By defining tasks, you can modularize your code and make it more maintainable.

### Example Task Definition

Here's an example of defining a task using the `@murnitur.task` decorator:

```python
from murnitur import task

@task(name="example_task")
def example_task(payload: Payload):
    # Task logic here
    return {"status": "completed"}
```


## Defining Tools with `@murnitur.tool`

Tools in Murnitur are utilities or helpers that perform specific functions. They can be used to encapsulate commonly used logic or functionality.

### Example Tool Definition

Here's an example of defining a tool using the `@murnitur.tool` decorator:

```python
from murnitur import tool

@tool(name="example_tool")
def example_tool(payload: Payload):
    # Tool logic here
    return {"result": "success"}
```
