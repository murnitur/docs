## SDK Setup Requirements

Setting up the SDK is required only if you wish to trace your LLM application. Currently, we support both Python and TypeScript, with ongoing efforts to enhance and expand our capabilities in these languages.

<CodeGroup>
```bash python 
pip install murnitur 
```

```bash typescript
npm i murnitur
```

</CodeGroup>

## Get API Key

To generate an API key for the SDK, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your account on [murnitur.ai](https://murnitur.ai).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** page.
3. Locate the API key section and generate a new key.
4. Copy the generated API key.
5. Add the copied API key to your SDK configuration.

This key will enable the SDK to authenticate subsequent request to murnitur.ai.

<CodeGroup>

```python python
import murnitur

murnitur.set_api_key("mt-ey...")

murnitur.init()

```

```typescript typescript
import * as murnitur from "murnitur"; // Must precede any llm module imports

murnitur.setApiKey("mt-ey..."); // or set MURNITUR_API_KEY in the .env file

murnitur.init();
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also set up the API key as follows:

```bash
export MURNITUR_API_KEY=mt-ey...
```

Setting the API key in the environment is advantageous because it eliminates the need to pass the key to functions that require it, as Murnitur will automatically detect it.
